ABOUT-TITLE = EASY QUIZZER V 2.0
ABOUT-TEXT = \tDeveloped with the aim of helping teachers from different areas to create automated tests that are unique for each student.\n\tEasyQuizzer stores all questions in a database management system. Subsequently, an exam is set up with the desired items. The program will then run randomization algorithms that will shuffle both the questions and the alternatives so that there are no two identical exams.\n\tProf. Dr. Anderson Rodrigues dos Santos guided their students Arthur Rodrigues Cruz and Jean Carlo Oliveira Santos in developing the former prototype as a Scientific Initiation project. The correction of errors and new functionalities, for example, the internationalization, were carried out as a project of scientific initiation of another student, Jo\u00e3o Barbosa de Souza Neto, also guided by Prof. Dr. Anderson Rodrigues dos Santos.
